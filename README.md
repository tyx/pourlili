# Pour Lili : My Baby Registry

Why the hell ?

I wanted something simple for people but nice, and not affiliated with a baby store. Guess what, I did not find my happyness. So why not building it to play with nice concept like Event sourcing ? High five !

## Objectives

- No RDBMs : Hey we talk about ~30 products, no login, no money. Sure I don't need a software that could handle millions transactions.
- No need to install any other app rather than apache/nginx. I want it to be easy to deploy and maintain. I have already a job, no need a second one.
- EventSourcing. Because I'm really enjoying the vision of this way of development.
- And a small challenge for myself to make a website perfectly usable on mobile. (my first one, I'm an API man)
